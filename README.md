# Pythamon - (UNM CS105 Project)
First CS Project (Pokemon Emerald Remake)

The project was originally created in Python 2.7, but has been ported to the newest version. Most code was kept intact to preserve code style.
Uses Python 3.10 and Pygame 2.0.

## Controls
- WASD or UpDownLeftRight work for movement
- Q: Run
- E: Walk

## Major updates
 - Removed most variables in main and moved them to separate classes.
 - Updated main to run off a state machine to save myself from a headache when porting over ;)
 - Most features work again! The game still has some bugs, but they're left in to keep this as preserved as possible (They existed and were known at submission time). Specifically the movement, collision, and event timing might not work correctly.
