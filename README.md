# Pokemon_CS105
First CS Project (Pokemon Emerald Remake)

The project was originally created in Python 2.7, but has been ported to the newest version. Most code was kept intact to preserve code style.
Uses Python 3.10 and Pygame 2.0.

## Major updates
 - Removed most variables in main and moved them to separate classes.
 - Updated main to run off a state machine to save myself from a headache when porting over ;)
 - Most features work once again, but the game is still sometimes buggy due to novice programming style when originally written. Specifically the collision & event timing might not work correctly.
